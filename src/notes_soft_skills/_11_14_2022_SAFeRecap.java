SAFe
	Proven for integrated patterns for large enterprise scale agile development.

	-Scalable
	-Modular

	SAFe synchronizes
		-Alignment
		-Collaboration Delivery

	SAFe leverages
		-agile development
		-Lean
		-System thinking
			Taking into consideration of the whole system.

	100% Delivery on Objectives

	In adopting SAFe, Aimed to evolve its process for scaling development teams in many ways: Create a fast and flexible flow across the entire ecosystem
	Create a system of teams across the ecosystem that work together to deliver quickly Scale up to adopt team growth Improve visibility with the objective of a two-month look-ahead on what each team will be working on
	Create mechanisms for teams and stakeholders to identify cross-team dependencies and add items to other teams' backlogs as needed Align key business dates across all of the programs, including security, data center moves, compliance, and marketing programs

	There are 4 levels to SAFe

		-Release Train 1st level called Essential level
		program level is executed by ART (Agile Release Train)

		Each ART is self organized teams that contain around 50-125 teams who help plan, commit, and execute together.

		-Cross-functional team
		-Taking concepts to deployment.

		Each agile release train has a common mission and vision

		System-level solutions every 2 weeks
		synchornizes team iterations
		accumulates team iterations into a Program increment (PI).

		Art include the team that define, build, and test features and components.

		Companies can chose whether to be in SAFe or Kanban.

		Software Quality Practices
			-have continuouis integration
			-test-first
			-refactoring
			-pair work
			-collective ownership

		-Each team has 5-9 people to build a quality increment value for iteration
			these can be software
			hardware

		-Scrum sprints have start and stop dates whereas kanban is an ongoing process.

-Team roles are clearly defined in scrum (product owner, dev team, and scrum master), while kanban has no formal roles. Both teams are self-organized.

A kanban board is used throughout the lifecycle of a project whereas a scrum board is cleared and recycled after each sprint.

A scrum board has a set number of tasks and strict deadline to complete them.

Kanban boards are more flexible with regards to tasks and timing. Tasks can be reprioritized, reassigned, or updated as needed.

Both kanban and scrum are popular agile frameworks with software developers. For more on this, read our full breakdown of kanban vs. scrum.

Release Train Engineer (RTE) - Act as the chief scrum master for the train product management

- Product Management defines and priotizes the program backlog system

- System Architect Engineering provides architecural and technical guidance.

- Business owners and customers are the key stakeholders on the ART

- System teams helps with infrastructure, assists with integrations, and performs A.R.T. level testing.



What happens in PI Planning?

Common Business and Technology Mission

They discuss the program vision and program backlong.

Program Increments (PI timeboxes (8-12 Weeks) and usually have 5-6 program increments.

iterations sprint - 2 weeks

Program Increment Plannign
https://www.scaledagileframework.com/pi-planning/


Day 1 Agenda Business context – A Business Owner or senior executive describes the current state of
the business, shares the Portfolio Vision, and presents a perspective on how effectively existing
solutions are addressing current customer needs. Product/solution vision – Product Management
presents the current vision (typically represented by the next top 10 upcoming features) and
highlights any changes from the previous PI planning event, as well as any forthcoming Milestones.
Architecture vision and development practices – System Architect/Engineering presents the
architecture vision. Also, a senior development manager may introduce Agile-supportive changes to
development practices, such as test automation, DevOps, Continuous Integration, and Continuous
Deployment, which are being advanced in the upcoming PI. Planning context and lunch – The RTE
presents the planning process and expected outcomes. Team breakouts #1 – In the breakout, teams
estimate their capacity for each Iteration and identify the backlog items they will likely need to
realize the features. Each team creates their draft plans, visible to all, iteration by iteration.
