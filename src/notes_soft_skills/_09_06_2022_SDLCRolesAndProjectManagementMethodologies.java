    Roles are in SDLC process

        Client: A person or organization has capital and idea

        Product Owner: A person is a bridge between client and development team

        Scrum Master: Servant of the team. Removes all the impediment from the team.


        UX Designer: Voice of the user. Making sure that application is user friendly.

        UI Designer: Interface of the application looks good and attractive.


        UX Designer makes decision where the box should be. And UI Designer makes sure how it looks.

        Software(System) Architect: They design the system to develop an application. They design the back-end, pick programming language, frameworks... They are SME (Subject Matter Expert)

        Software Developer: They are responsible to write the code and build the application.

        Software Tester: Making sure that functionality is matching with the requirements.

        End User: User who is using the application in the production environment.

        Waterfall Methodology - It is linear sequential approach to manage the project. Next step depends on the previous one. I can not move to the next phase without finishing the previous one.

        Agile Methodology - Agile is incremental and iterative approach to manage the project.

        Agile is faster and flexible when we develop the new application or functionality.

        As QE or SDET, we start writing the test cases on the development phase.

        Sprint: It is a time frame that development team is working on the functionalities (user story).

        User Story: Smallest piece of the project.
        User stories are written by PO.

        Sprint is usually 10 business days (two weeks).

        After sprint starts, while developers are working on the user stories, I am working understanding the requirements and start writing the test cases based on the requirements.

        After development is completed, I start testing the functionality using the test cases.

        Test Cases: It is a document includes test step, test data, pre-conditions and post-conditions for the specific test scenarios.


        --Sprint
        --User story
            Requirements (Acceptance Criteria)
        --User story points (1-2-3-5-8-13-21 Fibonacci Sequence)
        --Test Cases

        Syntax of:
        User Story: As a user, I should be able to login
        Test Cases: Validate that user is able to login with the valid credentials.
