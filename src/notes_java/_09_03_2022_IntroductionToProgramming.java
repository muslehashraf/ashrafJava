        What is computer?
        -Machine that takes instructions from users and gives output back.
        -Input -> Output
        -Hardware & software
        -Brain
        -storing and processing data, typically in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.
        -A computer is a device that accepts information (in the form of digitalized data) and manipulates it for some result based on a program, software, or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed.
        Hardware: Physical parts of the computer
        Software: Windows10
        CPU: Central Processing Unit
        Binary form - binary code - machine code - machine language
        - it is simply ones (ON) and zeros (OFF)
        - base-2 counting system
        oldest way of counting -> ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
        base-10 counting system -> 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ....
        base-2 counting system -> 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256
        1 -> 2
        2 -> 4
        3 -> 8
        13 -> 00001101
        39 -> 00100111
        STORAGE UNITs
        -a bit is a bulb that can be represented as one or zero
        -8 bits -> 1 byte
        byte capacity
        -it can hold 128 numbers (0 - 127 included)
        The range is -128 to 127
        A -> decimal representation ASCII 65 -> binary
        A -> 65 -> 01000001

        Natural vs Programming vs Binary
        Programming Language
        -set of commands - rules - algorithms
        -interface bt human and computer
        -code
        -logic
        -vocabulary!
        -grammar
        Natural languagues -> English, Russian, Arabic, Japan
        -vocabulary!
        -grammar
        Programming languages -> Java, Ruby, JS, C#, C++, Go
        -vocabulary! public, static, class, package, void
        -syntax
        ***Programming languages lack ambiguity
        Java 8, 11 -> LTS
        JAVA
        Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP)
        Java is platform independent (Mac OS, Windows)
        WRITE ONCE RUN EVERYWHERE -> WORE
        Platform = Operating Systems
        OS -> macOS, Windows, Linux
        Java is one of the most demanded programming languages in the field
        Java is easy to learn
        There is huge community that supports java learners
        Java can be used for web and Android mobile application, games etc.
        Demand -> Users -> Need -> Make life easier
        TAXI -> Expensive, wait time, plates
        UBER
                SDLC
        IDEA -> SDLC Phases -> Product (Software)
        Frontend - UI - GUI -> Graphical User Interface
            HTML + CSS + JS
        Backend -> Database & APIs
            Java, Ruby, Pyhton, GO, JS-NodeJS, .NET/C#
            OOP Principles
            It puts real life problems-objects into objects to be defined in a programming way
            public class Rider{
                String fName;
                String lName;
                String phoneNumber;
                BankAccountInfo bankAccountInfo;
            }
            public class BankAccountInfo{
                String accountNo;
                String routingNo;
            }
        We downloaded JAVA - jdk
        JDK -> Java Development Kit
        JDK = JRE + Development Tools (java, javac, jheap)
        JRE -> Java Runtime Environment
        JRE = Libraries + packages + JVM
        JVM = Java Virtual Machine
        JVM has JIT as well
        JIT -> Just in Time Compiler
        run = execute
        java  -> execute code
        javac -> compile code (byte code)
        Source code: it is any code written with a programming language
        EXAMPLE:
            public static void main(String[] args){
                System.out.println("Hello World!");
            }
        Byte code: it is compiled source code
            AASNBFKASLFJSAHFA2352NVLKS2342 - ASFNKASNFALSKNKdS23425234SDBKS
        Binary code: which is ones and zeros
        JAVA WAY: source code -> javac (compiled) -> byte code -> java -> binary code (ones and zeros)
        OTHER LANGUAGES -> source code -> compiler-executor -> binary code
        WINDOWS -> File Explorer - This PC

        HOW TO CREATE A NEW PROJECT ON INTELLIJ IDEA
        1. Launch IntelliJ IDEA
        2. Select "New Project"
        3. Give a unique name
            -DO NOT USE SPACES
        NAMING CONVENTION
        -No written rules but followed by all programmers
            1. package name
                - starts with lowercase
                - do not use spaces in package names
                - follows camelcase rule
                    myFirstPackage
                    my_first_package
            2. class name
                - starts with upper case
                - do not use spaces in class names
                - follows camelcase rule
                    MyFirstClass

        {} -> curly braces
        [] -> square brackets
        () -> parantheses
        <> -> Angle - diamond brackets
        "" -> double quotation
        '' -> single quotation
        >  -> greater
        <  -> less
        =  -> equal
        !  -> NOT - exclamation mark
        |  -> pipe -> OR
        &  -> AND
        \  -> back slash
        /  -> forward slash
        *  -> Asterisk - star
        ;  -> semicolon
        :  -> colon
        != -> NOT EQUAL
