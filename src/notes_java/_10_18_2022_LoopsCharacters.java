            Loops Recap:
        - Loops are used for repeating the same block of code either certain amount of time or reaching
        to termination condition.
        1. forI loop
        - When we know how many iterations that we are gonna run our code block.
        - We need:
        *start point
        *termination point
        *increment/decrement
        2. for each
        3. while
        - When we don't know how many iterations that we need for terminating our loop. We
        run the code block after we check the condition.
        - We need:
        *Condition
        4. do-while
        - When we don't know how many iterations that we need for terminating our loop. We
        run the code block first then check the condition.
        Character Class
        - Character class is wrapper class and it has useful methods such as:
        1. isLetter(char) -> boolean
        2. isDigit(char) -> boolean
        3. isLetterOrDigit(char) -> boolean
        4. isWhiteSpace(char) -> boolean
        - returns true if the given char is " " <-(space)
        5. isLowerCase(char) -> boolean
        6. isUpperCase(char) -> boolean
        */
